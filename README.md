# Semantic-Segmentation-Project

In this project I have labeled the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

To run the project, execute the following steps:
  * Clone this repository and 'cd' into it
  * Create a directory 'data'
  * Download the road dataset from <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/advanced_deep_learning/data_road.zip">this link</a> and extract the dataset zip file inside 'data' directory
  * Execute the command: '`python main.py`'

__Output of the project is present in directory '`./runs/1527612982.635694/`'.__
